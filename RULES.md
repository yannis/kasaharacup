# Kasahara Cup rules (2024 edition)

We will mainly follow the rules of EKF tournaments, namely those written in this document: https://www.ekf-eu.com/documents/32EKC%202023%20RULES%20FINAL.pdf

These rules may be adapted depending on the number of kenshis and categories entered.

## Team competition

### Pool

Every pool is in principle composed of three (3) teams, who fight in the following order: 1><2, 1><3, 2><3.

If the inscriptions make it necessary, pools of two (2) will be included.

The 4 teams that got the medals at the previous Team Championships will be seeded into different pools and removed to the far end of the grid.

Only the first team out of every pool will be entered on the tournament grid.

For the first round, the names and the order of combats shall be handed in at the managers’ meeting, all others at the administration table of the shiai-jo immediately after the end of the previous fight of the respective team.

The combats are played by "sanbon-shobu" and the duration is 3 minutes for all categories. Equality (hikiwake) will be declared in case no points are scored or if the score is one to one.

If two teams remain even at the end of the pool, a supplementary fight, between two of the team members will decide on the victory. This fight will be held according to the "ippon-shobu"-principle, without time limit.

### Tournament

Determination of the winning team in tournament matches will be made in the following order of precedence:

1. Highest number of individual winners; but, if it is a tie, then
1. Highest number of points scored.
1. Should 1. and 2. still be a tie, a play-off will be conducted in the tournament matches.
1. A default is regarded as a loss: the opponent is given 2 points.

## Individual competition

### Pool

Every pool is in principle composed of three fighters, who fight in the following order: 1><2, 1><3, 2><3.

In the case of pools composed of four, each one will fight 3 (three) times as follows:
1><2, 3><2, 3><4, 1><4, 1><3, 2><4.

It is possible that in this same order pools may be combined, or a different order of fights is announced. The division into different pools will be handled by drawing, on condition that fighters of the same club will be kept out of the same pool. Also, the 4 competitors that got the medals at the previous respective Championships will be seeded into different pools and moved to the corner of the elimination bracket.

The combat time is 3 minutes, following the “sanbon shobu” rule. If appropriate an even match (hikiwake) may be the result.
The fighters of the same pool will be ranked as follows. The criteria will be applied in that order and the subsequent criteria will be only applied if a clear decision is not reached:

1. The higher number of fights won; if it is still a tie, then
1. The lower number of fights lost; if it is still a tie, then
1. The higher number of hikiwake; if it is still a tie, then
1. The higher number of points scored; if it is still a tie, then
1. The lower number of points lost.

In case of equality between two fighters, one supplementary fight will take place immediately after the normal pool fights, to establish the final order among the fighters. These fights will follow the rule of "ippon shobu", without time limit.

In case of equality between all 3 fighters at the end of the pool, they will fight again the pool of 3 fighters following the "ippon shobu" principle. If even after two such rounds the order among the fighters is not clarified, the result shall be determined by lot (chusen).

### Tournament

After the pool system, the first and second out of every pool will be put on the tournament grid. The fights will follow the knockout system.

The combat time is 3 minutes for seniors and juniors, following the "sanbon shobu" rule, with the possibility of one prolongation (encho).

There is time limit of three minutes for the “encho”. 

If the "encho" is not enough to determine a winner after three minutes, the fight will be decided by shinpan-decisions (hantei) except for semi-final and finals, where encho without time limit will apply.
