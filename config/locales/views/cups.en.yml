      accomodation:
        dormitory: This year again we proposed dormitories located in the complex of the University Campus. It's located only one bus stop away from the competion hall or ten minutes by walk. Bed linens are provided and sleeping bags are not allowed. Please note that the number of beds is limited to 50! <br />By booking your night at the dorm, you will also receive a pass for Geneva's bus system (don't lose it!) for the days of Saturday and Sunday.
        hotels: If you prefer something more confortable you can chose from <a href='http://www.booking.com/region/ch/geneve-canton.fr.html?sid=7a2c0d77b1647e6dcf705c4dd663876d;dcid=1' target='_blank'>the many hotels</a> that Geneva and surrounding France offer.
