Kasahara sensei played a crucial role in the development of kendo in Switzerland.
        <br/>In 1972, his son, Kasahara Hiroaki sensei, then 22 years old and kendo 4th Dan, stayed in Switzerland for two years as the first Japanese Kendo professor directly send by the ZNKR.

In 2019, the 33rd edition gathered French, Italian, Japanese, English and of course Swiss kenshis.
